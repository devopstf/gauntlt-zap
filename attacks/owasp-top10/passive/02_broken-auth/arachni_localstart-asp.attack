Feature: Look for the possibility brute force possibilities

Background:
  Given "arachni" is installed
  And the following environment variables:
     | name       | environment_variable_name  |
     | url        | TARGET_HOSTNAME            |

Scenario: Check If localstart.asp exists, vulnerable to brute force attacks (Basic auth)
  When I launch an "arachni" attack with:
  """
  arachni <url> --checks=localstart_asp
  """
  Then the output should contain "0 issues were detected."

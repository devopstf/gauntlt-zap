Feature: Look for misconfiguration in directory listing

Background:
  Given "arachni" is installed
  And the following environment variables:
     | name       | environment_variable_name  |
     | url        | TARGET_HOSTNAME            |

Scenario: Check If I can get a directories list
  When I launch an "arachni" attack with:
  """
  arachni <url> --checks=directory_listing
  """
  Then the output should contain "0 issues were detected."

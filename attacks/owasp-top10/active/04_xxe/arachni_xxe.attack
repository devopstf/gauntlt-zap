Feature: Look for XML External Entities (XXE) using arachni against our site

Background:
  Given "arachni" is installed
  And the following environment variables:
     | name       | environment_variable_name  |
     | url        | TARGET_HOSTNAME            |

Scenario: Check if XXE is possible
  When I launch an "arachni" attack with:
  """
  arachni <url> --checks=xxe
  """
  Then the output should contain "0 issues were detected."

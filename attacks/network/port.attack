Feature: check to make sure the right ports are open on our server
  Background:
    Given "nmap" is installed
    And the following profile:
      | name       | value                       |
      | host       | docker.for.mac.localhost    |

  Scenario: Verify server is open on expected ports
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -F <host>
      """
    Then the output should match:
      """
      8008/tcp open
      """

Feature: check to make sure the right ports are open on our server that we set in our config/cucumber.yml

  Background:
    Given "nmap" is installed
    And the following environment variables:
     | name      | environment_variable_name |
     | hostname  | TARGET_HOSTNAME             |

  Scenario: Verify server is open on expected ports
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -F <hostname>
      """
   Then the output should contain "8008"
